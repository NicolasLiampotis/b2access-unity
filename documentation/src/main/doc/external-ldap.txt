=== LDAP 

LDAP based authentication allows for outsourcing credential verification to a server 
talking with the LDAP protocol, as OpenLDAP or Active Directory.

To configure LDAP authentication a server address must be provided as well as some information
regarding the LDAP directory schema. The amount of options varies depending on the amount of 
information that should be retrieved from LDAP. 

Let's consider an (complex) example:

----
ldap.servers.1=localhost
ldap.ports.1=389
ldap.userDNTemplate=cn={USERNAME},ou=users,dc=unity-example,dc=com
ldap.attributes.1=cn
ldap.attributes.2=sn
ldap.groupsBaseName=dc=unity-example,dc=com
ldap.groups.1.objectClass=posixGroup
ldap.groups.1.memberAttribute=memberUid
ldap.groups.1.matchByMemberAttribute=cn
ldap.groups.1.nameAttribute=cn
ldap.groups.2.objectClass=groupOfNames
ldap.groups.2.memberAttribute=member
ldap.groups.2.nameAttribute=cn
----

In this example a single LDAP server is configured (also alternative addresses may be added 
to take advantage of LDAP high availability deployment if it is set up): localhost:389.
The login name which is presented for authentication is converted to an LDAP DN using a template 
expression. Thanks to it the user needs not to enter the full DN.
The two attributes (+cn+ and +sn+) are going to be retrieved for the user.
Finally there are two group definitions, configuring how to extract group membership from LDAP.
In this case the LDAP server stores groups as separate tree nodes which contains group 
members as values of a designated attribute. 

In the both cases the groups are searched under the LDAP tree node +dc=unity-example,dc=com+. In the first
case the group objects have the class +posixGroup+. Members are listed as values of the +memberUid+ attribute.
What is more the values are not the full DNs of the members but only their +cn+ attributes. The 
group's short name is in its +cn+ attribute. The 2nd group definition is similar but another 
object class is used (+groupOfNames+), members are in other attribute (+members+) and are given 
with their full DNs.
