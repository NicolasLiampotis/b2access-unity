== Installation and operation manual

=== Prerequisites

Unity is tested on the Linux platform. Also other variants of Unix should be fine to run Unity.  

Unity theoretically can be run on Windows server, however we neither provide startup scripts for windows nor
test it. If you would love to run Unity on Windows machine, write to the support mailing list. 

Unity is distributed with everything needed to install and run the system except of Java. 
Java Runtime Environment 7 must be installed, both OpenJDK and Oracle distributions are supported.
It is strongly advised to use the latest, updated version of the JRE.

=== Fresh installation

If the +.tar.gz+ version is used, it must be simply downloaded and unpacked. A directory with Unity version
number is included. Typically the start script should be created or integrated with the startup system of the
machine. The distribution's +extra/+ folder may provide a suitable script. 
It is also a good idea to add the +INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY/bin/+ folder to the +PATH+ environment variable,
so the scripts are instantly available. This is assumed later on in all examples.  

If the +.rpm+ version is used it should be installed with the package manager. The only dependency is Java JRE,
which will be installed automatically if not yet available on the machine. The startup scripts are also installed
automatically. 

[NOTE]
In case of RPM installation the standard Linux directory layout is used. This manual uses the names of Unity 
subdirectories as found in the +.tar.gz+ distribution. The mapping of those folders to locations used in the case of 
the RPM installation is as follows:

[options="header"]
|===
|TAR.GZ			| RPM 
|bin/			| /usr/sbin/
|lib/			| /usr/share/unity-idm/lib/
|logs/			| /var/log/unity-idm/
|data/			| /var/lib/unity-idm/data/
|conf/			| /etc/unity-idm/
|===

Unity can be started right away, but most probably the default setting should be changed. 
Please refer to the <<quick_start>> or <<configuration>> sections for a short or detailed information how to 
configure the system.

=== Starting and stopping the server

Starting is simple:

----
$> unity-idm-server-start
----

It is always good to check the log files. The +log/unity-startup.log+ should contain only few lines saying that
the server started successfully. If there are any errors there, it means that a very low level problem happened, 
for instance the JRE is not available. The +log/unity-server.log+ should provide a more detailed information, 
which should be also checked. There should be no +ERROR+ and no +WARN+ entries.

Stopping the server is simple as well:

----
$> unity-idm-server-stop
----
