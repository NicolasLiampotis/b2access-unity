Binding:: Web (Vaadin)

This endpoint exposes the SAML 2 authentication interface, implementing the SSO profile
of the SAML HTTP-POST binding. If you do not plan to use SOAP clients, this endpoint can be safely disabled.

where a user can review and alter returned information and after acceptance redirects the user 
to the SAML Service Provider with a SAML response.

The options of the endpoint (besides the standard ones for the binding) are:
