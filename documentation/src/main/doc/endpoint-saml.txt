=== Web SAML SSO endpoint

Endpoint type:: +SAMLWebIdP+
Binding:: Web (Vaadin)
Exposed paths:: +/saml2idp-web+, +/metadata+

This endpoint exposes the SAML 2 authentication interface, implementing the SSO profile with the support for 
the SAML HTTP-POST and HTTP-Redirect bindings.

The endpoint first authenticates the redirected client, then presents a confirmation screen
where a user can review and alter a returned information and, after acceptance, redirects the user 
to the SAML Service Provider with a SAML response.

The metadata related features and configuration is the same as in the case of remote SAML authenticator 
(<<saml-metadata>>) with the exception that the metadata is published under the endpoint's address with 
the constant +/metadata+ suffix.

The options of the endpoint (besides the standard options for all Web endpoints) are:

[[endp-web-unicore]]
=== UNICORE Web SAML SSO endpoint

Endpoint type:: +SAMLUnicoreWebIdP+
Binding:: Web (Vaadin)
Exposed paths:: +/saml2unicoreIdp-web+, +metadata+

This endpoint is a slightly enhanced <<endp-web-saml>>, with the UNICORE 7 Grid middleware support.
It is useful for UNICORE portal SAML authentication, so if you don't integrate UNICORE portal with Unity 
don't use this endpoint.

The endpoint is configured in the same way as the <<endp-web-saml>>, the only functional difference is  
that it allow to generate and return UNICORE 7 trust delegations made for the relaying party.

Only the users with the X.500 identity (among others identities) may use this endpoint. However neither 
authentication with certificate nor possession of a X.509 certificate is required.

Binding:: Web Service (CXF)
Exposed paths:: +/saml2unicoreidp-soap+, +metadata+

This endpoint is a slightly enhanced version of <<endp-ws-saml>>, with the UNICORE 7 Grid middleware support.
It is useful for UNICORE standalone client (e.g. UCC) SAML authentication, if you don't integrate UNICORE with 
Unity this endpoint is useless.

The endpoint is configured in the same way as the <<endp-ws-saml>>, the only functional difference is  
that it generates and return UNICORE 7 trust delegations made for the client.

Only the users with the X.500 identity (among others identities) may use this endpoint. However neither 
authentication with certificate nor possession of a X.509 certificate is required.
